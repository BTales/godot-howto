Godot introduction, help, best practice

This is a collection of bits and pieces concerning the godot gaming engine, see https://godotengine.org/. The idea was to write down everything important I came across when using Godot 4 and to write it down in a farily compact way, hoping to make it easier to get started for somebody or other. Additionally it is meant to keep things clear for myself when restarting with the engine after some pause.

Of course, this is my very personal way to look at things - hope anybody finds it useful.
